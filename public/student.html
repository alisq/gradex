				ERROR: NATURE NOT FOUND is an exploratory, multimedia project that looks at our personal relationships with nature and how technological nature is changing those relationships. Different perspectives and timelines are explored and the design outcomes reflect the different outlooks on the subject. Full work can be seen <a href="https://ainihaider.com/error-nature-not-found" target="_blank">here.</a>

				About the designer
			</h6>
			<h6 class="description">
				Hello, I'm Aini! I'm a graphic designer who is also interested in motion graphics and illustration. I enjoy exploring different mediums for self-expression and creativity. While working I usually listen to lofi music or podcasts (Welcome to Night Vale is my all-time favourite podcast). When I'm not creating work you'll find me either reading a book or taking trips to galleries, museums and/or gardens around Toronto.
