<!-- 				<p class="uppercase">About the exhibit</p> -->
				<p class="description">
					Recession Grads is a digital archive & exhibition set to showcase the work of the Graphic Design 2020 graduating class at OCAD-U. The work featured on this site has been produced over an 8 month period of research, iteration, and craft. Supported by faculty and their classes, students produced work that pertained to their design practice and topics they were passionate about such as equity, sustainability, social justice, and more. Despite COVID-19 halting our work and cancelling our graduate show and exhibition GradEx105, students still worked to complete their projects for themselves, their professors, and this website. Recession Grads exists to acknowledge the situation of what it is like for us to graduate into a recession, and a period of time where everything is a missing glyph of uncertainty and at an indefinite pause. This site serves to showcase our work despite the circumstances and to start new traditions of archiving future graduates' work.

					Here is an example of a description this still needs to be written. is an exploratory, multimedia project that looks at our personal relationships with nature and how technological nature is changing those relationships. Different perspectives and timelines are explored and the design outcomes reflect the different outlooks on the subject. Full work can be seen
