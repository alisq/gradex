    "Short Bio": "My name is Tess and I am a Graphic Designer. My goal is to produce and publish my own work and my first step was this thesis. My work has been described as controlled chaos, and I have run with that in everything I do. For my thesis I took this concept and created illustrative collages using vintage photographs and my own illustrations to embody the feeling of a fairytale. I have always been enchanted with this genre and saw that I could add to it. I created three books using this style, with my own gothic tales to match.",

    "Project Title": "Vestige: A Reinvigoration of The Fairytale.",
    "Project Description": "My project looks into what about the fairytale genre drew the world's attention, and how to use those elements to bring it back to the cultural forefront. I decided to incorporate these elements into fresh takes on known tales, as well as some Gothic stories of my own. As the Gothic has always been my muse, I looked into the darker side of the genre and how to create stories that were beautifully haunting but hopeful. To match this writing style I created illustrative collages that immersed the reader into the tale. I used vintage photographs and my own illustrations to create glimpses into a different, darker, world. In the end I created three books in this style: \"Little Red\", \"Girl From The Sky\", and \"Dark Tales\". I hope you will enjoy this work and give that copy of the Grimm Brother's fairytales on your shelf another chance.",

The other takeaway from this project is how governments manipulate and fake information.",

Zines are a common medium of subcultures. Zines have contributed greatly to humanitarian issues of feminist, LGBTQ+, and health activism. Due to their ease of creation, cheapness of production, and the acceptance of difference and originality, zines make it easy for even members of marginalized groups to involve themselves.\n\nPink Press is an interactive project, featuring zines authored by Canadian zinesters and calling for continued participation of anyone willing to share their work. These zines, with different themes, authors, and formats are tied together by the Pink Press brand identity. The project shifts the perspective of post-colonialism from “the end of colonialism” to “the after of colonialism” as Canadians deal with Eurocentric after-effects of a colonial past.",

On the other side, capitalism is how behavioral targeting is used as a marketing method, because advertisers believe behavioral targeting formulate ads that align with the individual consumer's trackable preferences and needs, without conveying messages the viewer would find unappealing or irrelevant. Data Obscura wants the audience to think about the question of whether transparency and truth should be the ultimate aim online, and why have we failed even now to take notice of the effects of all this surveillance?",

From this idea, I thought it will be great if I can create something other than a traditional journal that gives nostalgia or flashback of their memories. \n\nThe first semester, I explored many sensory designs such as music and smell. From this process, I thought scent is the best way to express my idea since the sense of smell is the most effective way to trigger memories. \n\nI explored different scents with unique essential oils. When I was smelling certain scents, It triggered my memories from the past. I realized this project could be related to my memories.

In front of all the knowledge and information that we can access, we are losing the conflict from ourselves. The conflict comes from the unknowns, when we are facing the unknowns, we will start to question and we will try to answer the question even the answers are leading us to the unknowns that we have not known yet. The process seems pointless and frustrating but we cannot deny this pointlessness and escape from it. We must accept the nihilist of life and the conflict rooted in ourselves so that we are capable to keep exploring for something new.

This project seeks to translate sound into the familiar domain of the image. It seeks to harness the emotional, semantic, and mnemonic power of sound and apply it to graphic composition. Furthermore, it seeks to create a confluence and collaboration between author and audience and, furthermore, between the artifact and the environment in which it is immersed. \n\nGraphic Resonance seeks to create instruments—not for the composition of musical scores—but for the composition of graphic artifacts.",

The idea that anger breeds harm focuses on the outcomes of displaced anger, which by all means, is correct. However anger at injustice, oppression and unfair circumstances has to have the space to be expressed for the sake of personal freedom, societal change and improvement. This project is an exploration of difficult emotions and even though they can be visceral and ugly they can and should be given the space to exist and be expressed especially within and through the most underprivileged of women.\n\nPlease access it here: https://jesscvilo.com/",

Unfortunately, not everybody gets the opportunity to learn about these stories, which results in issues such as misrepresentation, racism and ungratefulness. To tackle this concern and shed light on the stories of diligent immigrants, I pursued the topic of Ontario’s Sikh history as my thesis topic in my Graphic Design capstone course at OCADU.",

Within the gaming community there has been certain biases directed to different kind of gamers. There were biases on who is expected to play the video game to what kind of people are part of the community. Within the biases of the community, the treatment towards every bias differs. There would seem to be different hierarchies on the biases and would give each bias different treatments. From my study of the community I will create a game which shows the hierarchal differences created by the concept of biases. \n \nhttps://kai-so.webflow.io/",

    "Project Description": "It is no surprise that homelessness is a growing issue in Toronto because we see it on the streets all the time. Homelessness is a complicated issue but some things can be done. In my research, I found that there is not much separation between ourselves and a homeless person. They have a story, a career, a family, friends, a life before they became homeless. But due to a series of circumstances, they ended up on the streets. Some people see the homeless as people who had never lived before as supposed to see them compassionately and understand their situations and stories. Therefore, this thesis project aims to create an awareness campaign that encourages respect and compassion towards these less vulnerable individuals. It challenges the audience to let go of their biases stigmatizing attitudes in favour of a more open-minded and humane understanding of the issue.",

Children of immigrants often struggle to relate to their parents’ cultural background because they lack the environmental elements that constitute their culture, such as nationality, language, or clothing, however, food is the common element that most have access to. While the exploration of culture through food has been widely studied within the fields of anthropology, sociology and cultural studies, I saw an opportunity for food studies to be engaged/addressed through communication studies. The overall intention of the project is to encourage people to reflect on their own feelings and experiences with cultural identity, in relation to cultural dishes. Through this project I hope to offer an opportunity for people to connect with their cultural identity.",

Treasure Trove seeks to document the relationships we have with objects and the many forms they may take. First-hand experiences are prioritized over classist ideas of high or low art, which are disregarded in favour of these human connections. These object relationships play a large role in our lives whether we realize it or not. By examining how they shape our sense of self, identities, and relationships with others, we gain a better understanding not only of ourselves, but others too.",

    "Project Description": "Onomatopoeic expressions are elements of speech and writing which convey meaning through phonetic imitation. \"KACHI BUWA\" investigates how graphic representation can communicate the nuances in connotations and culture-specific contexts expressed by onomatopoeia in the Japanese language. This project exists as a body of typographic work orbiting around a conceptual variable Katakana typeface which aims at bridging sound, form and signification while being embedded in Japanese visual culture.\n\nOnomatopoeias speak their meanings through both sound and form, breaking linguistic barriers and granting a strictly iconic form of communication.",

    "Project Description": "Over the years it seems that graphic design has become almost entirely digital. Although there are obvious benefits there have been losses as well. Digital design has become more repetitive, 2 dimensional, and simplistic. Incorporating handmade elements into design has benefits not just for the work itself, but for the designer. Working with handmade materials and techniques provides a wider selection of tools and styles, and creates more interdisciplinary design. It also helps the designer gain a better understanding of fundamental elements of design including form, texture, and colour. This book showcases 20 different materials and techniques that can be incorporated into graphic design, or simply explored on their own.",

I have noticed for graphic design specifically works typically involve the sense of sight solely. I pondered on the concept of how engaging in all the senses could heighten the experiences for the audience.

If I was trying to relieve child stress effectively, why should I use technology or digital forms that make them stressed? Then I decided to go completely analog.\n\nThen I created Naemo, an analog communication tool for parents and children in 2100. It encourages them to move away from technology and focus solely on the child’s emotions and the conversation. However, this activity ironically cannot be completed without the app Zyli (that monitor children emotions). It shows that it is impossible for anyone in the future to be completely free from technology. Using the 40 textured Naemo cards, children will be creating their very own narrative and express their emotions through communication.",

The progression of my work over the past few months brings to light the amount of control we have in our lives. Over the span of the school year, I researched various systems we as a civilization have implemented within our lives to build order, ease, and purpose.

    "Project Title": "What If",
    "Project Description": "The “What If” project stemmed from my own anxieties about the future. “What If” is about the negative self-talk we sometimes have when we doubt ourselves.  The “What If” Poetry Book is about each individual’s experience with anxiety. I interviewed 9 different people and asked each of them to share a story about a time in their lives where they felt anxious in any way. After each interviewee shared their own experience, I then asked them to write their own “what if” statement followed by a drawing of what anxiety looks like to them.  Each poem was written based on each individual’s experience and the answers I received during their interviews. The “What If” project is composed of the “What If Poetry Book” as well as the “What If Interview Book” which can be found on my website.",

The focus here is on the relationship between digital media and its users, and how manipulators use this relationship against users for manipulative purposes.\n\nTo help the audience to understand better, a sweets company branding, Sweet Talk, is created, along with different types of products to represent different forms of media manipulation; which are medical, bullying, politics and insecurity. However, none of the sweets are edible, which is to represent the idea that none of the misinformation online is helpful to its audience.",

The goal of this body of work is to inform and educate everyone on the impact of colonialism and its effects on Filipino people. At its root, the issue of colonial mentality derives its origin from the oppressive treatment and indoctrination of Western ideals by Spain and the United States, to the indigenous people of the Philippines. This internalized oppression of Filipino culture and identity is a pervading psychological behaviour amongst the ethnic group. This project aims to look at its effect and influence on the Filipino culture to create a \ndiscourse of Filipino identity and what it means to be Filipino today.",

    "Project Description": "At the beginning of this project, my vision was unclear, fast forward eight months, and I have created lettering and typographic explorations that have allowed me to construct a creative process for myself as a designer. This body of work I created contains explorations which are deeply rooted in documentation of my process. The idea of exploring unconventional handwriting tools and processes has played a significant role in my project from the early stages. It may be hard for me to pinpoint exactly the issue or problem my work is attempting to address but I would say this project demonstrates how I created a process for myself when it comes to creating typographical exploration responses to content that reflects these explorations. This process I created for myself while working through these projects has allowed me to find where my personal practice lies in the world of graphic design.",
