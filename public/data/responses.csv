My work has been described as controlled chaos, and I have run with that in everything I do. For my thesis I took this concept and created illustrative collages using vintage photographs and my own illustrations to embody the feeling of a fairytale. I have always been enchanted with this genre and saw that I could add to it. I created three books using this style, with my own gothic tales to match.","Lewis Nicholson","","charlottetessdunn@gmail.com","https://charlottetessdunn.myportfolio.com/","https://www.instagram.com/charlottetess_","","https://www.linkedin.com/in/tess-dunn-878181133","Analog or Digital?","Why not both?

I decided to incorporate these elements into fresh takes on known tales, as well as some Gothic stories of my own. As the Gothic has always been my muse, I looked into the darker side of the genre and how to create stories that were beautifully haunting but hopeful. To match this writing style I created illustrative collages that immersed the reader into the tale. I used vintage photographs and my own illustrations to create glimpses into a different, darker, world. In the end I created three books in this style: ""Little Red"", ""Girl From The Sky"", and ""Dark Tales"". I hope you will enjoy this work and give that copy of the Grimm Brother's fairytales on your shelf another chance.","Publication;Typography;Illustration, Writing","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1_zrg2R2VtTwK6P0QizxvzW7LZIVnDP8e","An illustration from my book ""Dark Tales"" from the story Rain-Stained Night.

My idea started with a lost memory of mine. I lost my journal when I was in elementary school. Which means I don't have any journals to read what I was like back then. From this idea, I thought it will be great if I can create something other than a traditional journal that gives nostalgia or flashback of their memories. 

The first semester, I explored many sensory designs such as music and smell. From this process, I thought scent is the best way to express my idea since the sense of smell is the most effective way to trigger memories. 

I explored different scents with unique essential oils. When I was smelling certain scents, It triggered my memories from the past. I realized this project could be related to my memories. Thus, I started to make candles based on the scents related to my memory.

The process seems pointless and frustrating but we cannot deny this pointlessness and escape from it. We must accept the nihilist of life and the conflict rooted in ourselves so that we are capable to keep exploring for something new.

A lot of those feelings stem from the underlying societal expectation that anger should be sublimated or otherwise ignored especially by women.

However anger at injustice, oppression and unfair circumstances has to have the space to be expressed for the sake of personal freedom, societal change and improvement. This project is an exploration of difficult emotions and even though they can be visceral and ugly they can and should be given the space to exist and be expressed especially within and through the most underprivileged of women.

Unfortunately, not everybody gets the opportunity to learn about these stories, which results in issues such as misrepresentation, racism and ungratefulness.

Since the future will be a digital world, all main stressors of children would be related to technology. If I was trying to relieve child stress effectively, why should I use technology or digital forms that make them stressed? Then I decided to go completely analog.

Then I created Naemo, an analog communication tool for parents and children in 2100. It encourages them to move away from technology and focus solely on the child’s emotions and the conversation. However, this activity ironically cannot be completed without the app Zyli (that monitor children emotions). It shows that it is impossible for anyone in the future to be completely free from technology. Using the 40 textured Naemo cards, children will be creating their very own narrative and express their emotions through communication.

The “What If” project stemmed from my own anxieties about the future. “What If” is about the negative self-talk we sometimes have when we doubt ourselves.  The “What If” Poetry Book is about each individual’s experience with anxiety. I interviewed 9 different people and asked each of them to share a story about a time in their lives where they felt anxious in any way. After each interviewee shared their own experience, I then asked them to write their own “what if” statement followed by a drawing of what anxiety looks like to them.  Each poem was written based on each individual’s experience and the answers I received during their interviews. The “What If” project is composed of the “What If Poetry Book” as well as the “What If Interview Book” which can be found on my website.

The campaign uses blue throughout, inspired by the Prussian blue pigment produced by the oxidation of the photosensitive solution during the image-making process.","Branding;Publication;Campaigns;Typography","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1IhtktHnUxB4fQxmeAnp90RVNTsgRQ0h-","","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1yyo5PKM3k5QUY7fmN2rx4MZZcoImenCU","The information guide synthesizes my research with a focus on the effects of light pollution on human health.

This internalized oppression of Filipino culture and identity is a pervading psychological behaviour amongst the ethnic group.

The idea of exploring unconventional handwriting tools and processes has played a significant role in my project from the early stages. It may be hard for me to pinpoint exactly the issue or problem my work is attempting to address but I would say this project demonstrates how I created a process for myself when it comes to creating typographical exploration responses to content that reflects these explorations.
