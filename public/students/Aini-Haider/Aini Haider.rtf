Bio: Hello, I'm Aini! I'm a graphic designer who is also interested in motion graphics and illustration. I enjoy exploring different mediums for self-expression and creativity. While working I usually listen to lofi music or podcasts (Welcome to Night Vale is my all-time favourite podcast). When I'm not creating work you'll find me either reading a book or taking trips to galleries, museums and/or gardens around Toronto.\
