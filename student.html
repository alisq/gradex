				<h5>
				I am a Toronto based graphic designer who works across media. I have just completed my final year at OCAD-U, majoring in Graphic Design with a love for publications, exhibition design, typography, and motion graphics. My practice focuses on building foundations and frameworks, collaboration, and the discourse within Graphic Design, and using humour to always keep it approachable and well—me!
